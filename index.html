        <p style="line-height: 1.7rem; width: 50rem;"> Winnie-the-Pooh, also known as Pooh, is a fictional character created by an English author, A.A. Milne. Pooh is the main  character of the <!-- 12. the <i> tag is used to italicize text --> <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i> books that were first published in 1925. Pooh is based on a stuffed teddy bear that Milne got for his son, Christopher Robbin. Pooh is a soft, cuddly, yellow teddy bear with a kind and friendly personality. He is often described as “a bear of very little brain,” therefore he often comes off as naive, innocent, and childlike. Pooh is extremely optimistic and occasionally gives insightful advice in times of despair, despite being less intelligent than his friends.</p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.7rem; width: 50rem;"> Pooh lives in a tree house in the Hundred Acre Wood. There is a sign above the door of his house that reads “Mr. Sanders” and a sign beside his doorbell that says, “Ring Also”. Inside his home is a mirror, Pooh-koo clock, kitchen cabinets, dining table, and his bedroom. The kitchen cabinets are filled with jars of honey that Pooh harvests from beehives during the day. His honey supply often runs empty due to his unquenchable appetite.</p>
